1. Robot framework is a generic test automation framework which is widely used for Acceptance Testing .
2. Generally Business users who might be having less technical knowledge will be able to work with this framework and can perform the acceptance test
3. Provide automation with minimal Programming
4. It is a keyword driven framework. We have Libraries with lots of pre-defined keywords available to achieve Selenium test/DB test/Sikuli/API etc .
5. Built on top of Python and Java
6. IT's Free of cost
5. The code is in a distributed structure where the Program is distributed in to Settings, Variables, Testcases etc
6. Here in Robot Framework,
   1. Each file is a test suite
   2. Each folder and subfolder under testcase folder are test suites
      Which has other test suites inside it .
      to execute all the files in the robot framework - robot <foldername>

7. robot -i <Tagname> <Test Foldername>
8. robot -i <Tagname> <Test file name>.robot
12. robot  -i <Tag1> -i <Tag2> <Suitename>.robot - To include the testcases with tags
13. robot -e <tag> <suitename> - To exclude the tests with tags
14. robot -e <tag1> -e <tag2> <suitename>
15. robot -i <Tag1>AND<Tag2> TestSuiteFolder - Those testcases with both the tags will be executed
16. robot -i <Tag1>NOT<Tag2> TestSuiteFolder - Those testcases with Tag1 Present and Tag2 not present
17. robot -i <Tag1>OR<Tag2> TestSuiteFolder - Those testcases with either Tag1 or Tag2 are present
18. robot -s <TestSuiteName> <TestFolderName> - To execute the particular test suite file from the test folder
19. robot -r <Report Relative f
older path>  <SuiteToRun> - To store the reports.html in the specific folder path
20. robot -r <Report Relative folder path> -o <output folder path/output.xml> -l <Logfolderpath/log.html>  <SuiteToRun> - To store the reports.html in the specific folder path
9. To execute a particular testcase alone -  robot -t <testcasename>  <testfilename>.robot
10. We can add 'default' tags to those testcases to which user has not added any tags .
11. 'Force Tags' will be applied to all the testcases irrespective of whether the tags are added/not

How to save the output files ??
By default, the html execution result files will be saved in the location/folder from which we ran the test cases .


./Reports - Means, report folder will be created within the current folder path given
../Reports means reports folder will be created within the folder which is one step up .
